The Report
You are given two tables: Students and Grades. Students contains three columns ID, Name and Marks.

Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students 
who received a grade lower than 8. The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. 
If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. 
Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. 
If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.

Write a query to help Eve.

Note: Print "NULL" as the name if the grade is less than 8.

ANSWER :--

#### 1)
SELECT CASE 
	WHEN Grades.Grade < 8 THEN 'NULL' 
	ELSE Students.Name 
	END 
, Grades.Grade, Students.Marks 
FROM Students, Grades 
WHERE Students.Marks >= Grades.Min_mark AND Students.Marks <= Grades.Max_mark 
ORDER BY Grades.Grade DESC, Students.Name;

#### 2)
  -- Using Select Case
  
SELECT CASE
WHEN G.Grade > 7
THEN CONCAT(S.NAME, ' ', G.Grade, ' ', S.Marks)
ELSE CONCAT('NULL', ' ', G.Grade, ' ', S.Marks)
END
AS 'Tab'
FROM
Students S 
JOIN Grades G
WHERE S.Marks BETWEEN G.Min_Mark and G.Max_Mark
ORDER BY G.Grade DESC, S.NAME;

#### 3)
            -- Simplified Solution
            
SELECT IF(Grade > 7 , Name, 'NULL'), Grade, Marks
FROM Students JOIN Grades
WHERE Marks BETWEEN Min_Mark and Max_Mark
ORDER BY Grade DESC, Name;
